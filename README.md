# Odin Mode v1
Simple emacs major mode for the Odin language. Only syntax colouring and indentation provided, though more complex features such as static linting and autocompletion can be expected in the future.

# Usage
This is not a package available on MEPLA. To use this, download odin-mode.el and set it in your emacs configuration file and set its directory in your load path e.g. `(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")`.
